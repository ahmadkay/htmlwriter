# htmlwriter
a library for python to help write a complete html document from beginning to the end.

All you need to do is to copy this to the folder you want and start using it. 

I tried to document every function So anyone can understand what each function does.

I generated my whole website with this python library so I hope it would be useful for others as well.

a sample is also included. sample.html was generated by sample.py

enjoy making html pages.
